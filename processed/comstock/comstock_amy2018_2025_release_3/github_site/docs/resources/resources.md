## Tableau Dashboards
The [ComStock Tableau Public page](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/comstock.nrel/vizzes) offers interactive visualizations derived from the public ComStock datasets. These visualizations provide insights into building characteristics, energy consumption patterns, and the potential impacts of energy efficiency measures across various building types and geographic regions. See below for a sample of available dashboards. Additional dashboards will be posted to the ComStock Tableau Public page as they become available.

<summary><b>Geographic Clustering Reference Documentation</b></summary>
These documents provide reference documentation for the clustering methodology developed by ComStock. The clustering algorithm described in this technical report resulted in 88 clusters across the United States. The clusters are used as the geographic basis for the “U.S. Building Stock Segmentation Series” published by DOE’s Building Technologies Office. This series will provide geographically relevant insight into building stock characteristics, energy and emissions performance, and, eventually, common end use technologies. The cluster definitions file maps counties to building stock segmentation clusters.

<summary><b>Building Stock Segmentation</b></summary>
This document discusses the development of a segmentation approach for the U.S. commercial building stock that focuses on identifying similarities. The resulting nine-segment approach primarily uses similarities in heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems, service water heating
systems, and the presence of cooking equipment to separate buildings into categories.
